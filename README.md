# Candate

Candate is a dating webapp to connect you with your most compatible singles using interest, age, location, and preferred gender filters. 

CanDate is more effective at finding potential matches by personalizing the user's home page to a list of candidates based on the user's preferences and interests. At sign up, the user selects his or her interests and personal information, for CanDate to find user profiles that are most compatible with the user. Each profile is given a _match percentage_ to indicate how well their profiles match.

### **Most compatible matches**: 
Each profile has a match percentage that indicates how well the profile's interests matches that of the user's.
